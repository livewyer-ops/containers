# LiveWyer container image for git, gh, glab CLIes

[git](https://github.com/git/git) is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level
operations and full access to internals.

[gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) is GitHub on the command line.
It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code.

[GLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) is an open source GitLab CLI tool bringing GitLab to your terminal next to where you are already working with git
and your code without switching between windows and browser tabs.
Work with issues, merge requests, watch running pipelines directly from your CLI among other features.

This image is packaged by [LiveWyer](https://livewyer.io) for CI use.
